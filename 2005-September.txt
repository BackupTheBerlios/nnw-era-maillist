Hello so good people

We promote a new era. An international initiative out of the sciences also 
for world peace. And much more.

One of the basic papers is the layers everywhere paper. Layers in the 
ground, sediment layers. Layers in the forest, layers of life. Layers in 
the air. Layers in your skin. Papers have layers. A written story has 
layers, reading between the lines.

And for some people this is still an eye-opener. Written in a so easy 
style. People need only the ability they can read.

I also can show it in Spanish:

The press has to be honest while high politician can lie. Therefore we need 
the press.

Look now again Katrina. When there's an industry or whatsoever and people 
are working there and a small fire is starting.

Then some tells it can become a big fire. But he doesn't do anything. And 
then that building burns down. Help pours in for the victims. Yes it was a 
hell of a fire. Maybe some early action and we would have hardly any 
damage. Don't you think people wouldn't do it. Only crying what a big fire 
is arriving.

So the expensive solution for Katrina. What is the solution in this 
country? Higher and stronger levees. The Deltaplan. What will happen with 
the next hurricanes? Please invest in higher and stronger levees. That is 
cheap. Preventing disasters.

Press, please awake!

And please have a nice day. Don't drown in the information,

You are free to spread this news.

Please have a lovely day, and take care
